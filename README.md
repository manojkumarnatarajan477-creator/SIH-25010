## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## PROPOSED SOLUTION
<ul> <li>Create a **Blockchain-enabled Farm-to-Table Traceability System** that allows small and marginal farmers to digitally record and authenticate their farming practices, including seed type, fertilizer and pesticide usage, harvest dates, and transport history.</li> <li>This transparent system builds consumer trust by verifying organic and sustainable farming claims, enabling farmers to access premium markets and fair pricing directly.</li> <li>The mobile app supports multilingual voice commands for easy data entry by low-literacy users and incorporates AI-driven demand forecasting to help farmers plan crops based on market needs, thereby reducing wastage and increasing profitability.</li> </ul>

## TECHNICAL SUPPORT
<ul> <li>Technologies: Blockchain platforms like Hyperledger or Ethereum for immutable record-keeping; Python and TensorFlow for AI-powered demand forecasting; React Native for cross-platform mobile app development; cloud services for data storage and processing; voice recognition APIs for multilingual, voice-based interaction.</li> <li>Methodology: Farmers input farming practice data into the app → blockchain records create an immutable trace → AI analyzes market demand trends and provides crop planning recommendations → consumers and retailers access verified produce information → government and NGOs use data analytics dashboards for monitoring and support.</li> </ul>

## FEASIBILITY AND VIABILITY
 <ul> <li>Blockchain and AI technologies are mature, scalable, and increasingly cost-effective, making the solution technically feasible.</li> <li>Challenges include limited internet connectivity in rural areas, initial user training, and adoption resistance.</li> <li>Strategies to overcome these include designing offline app modes with periodic syncing, partnering with local cooperatives and government agencies for farmer education, and providing incentives for platform usage.</li> </ul>
 
## IMPACT AND BENIFITS
<ul> <li>Empowers small farmers by increasing transparency, building consumer trust, and enabling access to premium markets, which can boost incomes.</li> <li>Reduces exploitation by middlemen and supports sustainable, responsible farming through verified organic practices.</li> <li>Enables data-driven agricultural planning, reducing post-harvest losses and improving food security.</li> </ul>
